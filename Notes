Player attributes:

player  int             1 || 2 -> Player number id
length  int             player length
width   int             player width
x       int             player x-coord of top-left corner
y       int             player y-coord of top-left corner
dx      int             player's velocity on the x-Axis -> 0
dy      int             player's velocity on the y-Axis
goals   int             player's goals scored
rect    pygame.Rect     rect(x,y,length,width) object -> can be used to determine collisions and corner coordinates.


Player methods:

changeDirection = 1 -> DOWN
changeDirection = 0 -> UP
move                -> moves player in dy direction until it hits a wall, changing dy to -dy

Ball attributes:

radius      int         radius of the ball
x           int         x coordinate of center of ball
y           int         y coordinate of center of ball
dx          int, float  x velocity of ball
dy          int, float  y velocity of ball


Ball methods:

reset               -> resets ball's x,y,dx,dy; displays score to console
move                -> updates ball's x,y by dx and dy, and checks for collisions with players
